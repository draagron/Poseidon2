# Bugfix Workflow

## Overview

The bugfix workflow is designed for fixing defects in existing code. It enforces a **regression-test-first** approach to ensure bugs are properly captured and prevented from recurring.

## When to Use

Use `/speckit.bugfix` when:

- A specific behavior is broken or incorrect
- Users report unexpected behavior
- Tests reveal a failure in existing functionality
- Production monitoring detects an issue
- Edge cases cause crashes or errors

**Do NOT use `/speckit.bugfix` for**:
- Adding new features → use `/speckit.specify` instead
- Changing existing feature behavior intentionally → use `/speckit.modify` instead
- Code quality improvements without behavior change → use `/speckit.refactor` instead
- Emergency production issues → use `/speckit.hotfix` instead

## Process

### 1. Investigation Phase
- Reproduce the bug locally
- Document exact reproduction steps
- Capture error messages, stack traces, logs
- Identify root cause in code

### 2. Regression Test Phase (BEFORE FIX)
**CRITICAL**: Write failing test BEFORE applying fix
- Write test that reproduces the bug
- Verify test fails on current code
- Test should pass after fix is applied

### 3. Fix Implementation
- Make minimal changes to resolve issue
- Focus on root cause, not symptoms
- Update related tests if needed
- Verify test now passes

### 4. Verification
- All tests pass (old + new)
- Bug cannot be reproduced
- No regressions in related functionality
- Code review if appropriate

### 5. Prevention
- Document why bug occurred
- Identify if similar bugs exist elsewhere
- Consider adding additional test coverage
- Update documentation if needed

## Quality Gates

- ✅ Bug MUST be reproducible with documented steps
- ✅ Regression test MUST be written before fix is applied
- ✅ Root cause MUST be identified and documented
- ✅ Prevention strategy MUST be defined
- ✅ All tests MUST pass before marking complete

## Files Created

```
specs/
└── bugfix-001-description/
    ├── bug-report.md      # Bug documentation (created by /speckit.bugfix)
    ├── plan.md            # Fix plan (created by /speckit.plan after review)
    └── tasks.md           # Task breakdown (created by /speckit.tasks after plan review)
```

## Command Usage

```bash
/speckit.bugfix "button click doesn't save form data"
```

This will:
1. Create branch `bugfix/001-button-click-doesnt`
2. Generate `bug-report.md` with template
3. Set `SPECIFY_BUGFIX` environment variable
4. Show "Next Steps" for checkpoint-based workflow

**Next steps after running the command:**
1. Review and investigate the bug
2. Update `bug-report.md` with root cause analysis
3. Run `/speckit.plan` to create fix plan (include regression test strategy)
4. Review the plan - adjust approach if needed
5. Run `/speckit.tasks` to break down the fix into tasks
6. Review the tasks - ensure regression test comes before fix
7. Run `/speckit.implement` to execute the fix

## Example Bug Report

```markdown
# Bug Report: Button Click Doesn't Save Form Data

**Bug ID**: bugfix-001
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Investigating

## Current Behavior
When clicking the "Save" button on the profile form, the data is not persisted to the database.

## Expected Behavior
Clicking "Save" should persist all form fields to the database and show a success message.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to /profile/edit
2. Change username field to "newusername"
3. Click "Save" button
4. Refresh page
5. Observe username has not changed

## Root Cause
The form submission handler is missing the `await` keyword before the database call, causing the function to return before the data is saved.

File: `app/routes/profile.edit.tsx:45`
```

## Checkpoint-Based Workflow

The bugfix workflow uses a checkpoint-based approach to ensure you review and approve the fix strategy before implementation:

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis
- **Command**: `/speckit.bugfix "bug description"`
- **Creates**: `bug-report.md` with initial analysis
- **Checkpoint**: Review bug report, reproduce bug, identify root cause

### Phase 2: Fix Planning
- **Command**: `/speckit.plan`
- **Creates**: `plan.md` with fix strategy and regression test approach
- **Checkpoint**: Review plan - is the approach correct? Will regression test catch this?

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown
- **Command**: `/speckit.tasks`
- **Creates**: `tasks.md` with sequential tasks
- **Checkpoint**: Review tasks - is regression test BEFORE fix? Are tasks in correct order?

### Phase 4: Implementation
- **Command**: `/speckit.implement`
- **Executes**: All tasks in sequence (reproduce, write test, apply fix, verify)
- **Result**: Bug fixed with regression test preventing recurrence

**Why checkpoints matter**: Previous auto-implementation had 0% success rate (2/2 failures) because users couldn't review/adjust the fix approach. Checkpoints give you control at each phase.

## Tips

### Fast Bug Triage

1. Can you reproduce it? If not, gather more info
2. Is it a regression? Check when it broke (git bisect)
3. What changed? Review recent commits/PRs
4. Who owns this code? Check git blame

### Writing Good Regression Tests

```typescript
// Good: Specific test that reproduces the bug
test('profile save button persists data to database', async () => {
  await fillForm({ username: 'newusername' })
  await clickSaveButton()
  await refreshPage()
  const username = await getUsername()
  expect(username).toBe('newusername')
})

// Bad: Generic test that doesn't isolate the bug
test('profile form works', async () => {
  await testProfileForm()
})
```

### Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Applying fix before writing test → Won't catch regressions
- ❌ Treating symptoms instead of root cause → Bug will return
- ❌ Skipping documentation → Team won't learn from it
- ❌ Over-engineering the fix → Introduces new bugs

## Integration with Constitution

This workflow upholds:

- **Section III: Test-Driven Development** - Regression test before fix
- **Section VI: Workflow Selection** - Proper workflow for defect remediation
- **Quality Gates** - Bug reproduction and prevention required

## Related Workflows

- **Hotfix** - For emergency production bugs (expedited, test after fix)
- **Modify** - For intentional behavior changes
- **Refactor** - For improving code without changing behavior

## Metrics

Track these for continuous improvement:

- Time from bug report to fix
- Percentage of bugs caught by tests vs. production
- Recurrence rate (same bug appearing again)
- Number of bugs per feature
