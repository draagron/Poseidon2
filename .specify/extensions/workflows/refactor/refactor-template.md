# Refactor Spec: [IMPROVEMENT DESCRIPTION]

**Refactor ID**: refactor-###
**Branch**: `refactor/###-short-description`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Type**: [ ] Performance | [ ] Maintainability | [ ] Security | [ ] Architecture | [ ] Tech Debt
**Impact**: [ ] High Risk | [ ] Medium Risk | [ ] Low Risk
**Status**: [ ] Planning | [ ] Baseline Captured | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Validation | [ ] Complete

## Input
User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Motivation

### Current State Problems
**Code Smell(s)**:
- [ ] Duplication (DRY violation)
- [ ] God Object/Class (too many responsibilities)
- [ ] Long Method (too complex)
- [ ] Feature Envy (accessing other object's data)
- [ ] Primitive Obsession
- [ ] Dead Code
- [ ] Magic Numbers/Strings
- [ ] Tight Coupling
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Concrete Examples**:
- [File1.ts lines XX-YY: duplicated logic in 3 places]
- [File2.tsx lines AA-BB: 200-line function doing too much]
- [Service.ts: direct database access instead of using repository]

### Business/Technical Justification
[Why is this refactoring needed NOW?]
- [ ] Blocking new features
- [ ] Performance degradation
- [ ] Security vulnerability
- [ ] Causing frequent bugs
- [ ] Developer velocity impact
- [ ] Technical debt accumulation
- [ ] Other: [explain]

## Proposed Improvement

### Refactoring Pattern/Technique
**Primary Technique**: [Extract Method | Extract Class | Introduce Parameter Object | Replace Conditional with Polymorphism | etc.]

**High-Level Approach**:
[2-3 sentences explaining the refactoring strategy]

**Files Affected**:
- **Modified**: [file1.ts, file2.tsx, file3.ts]
- **Created**: [new-file.ts - extracted logic]
- **Deleted**: [old-file.ts - no longer needed]
- **Moved**: [util.ts → lib/util.ts]

### Design Improvements
**Before**:
```
[Simple diagram or description of current structure]
ComponentA → DirectDatabaseAccess
ComponentB → DirectDatabaseAccess
ComponentC → DirectDatabaseAccess
```

**After**:
```
[Simple diagram or description of improved structure]
ComponentA → Repository → Database
ComponentB → Repository → Database
ComponentC → Repository → Database
```

## Baseline Metrics
*Captured before refactoring begins - see metrics-before.md*

### Code Complexity
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: [number or "not measured"]
- **Cognitive Complexity**: [number or "not measured"]
- **Lines of Code**: [number]
- **Function Length (avg/max)**: [avg: X lines, max: Y lines]
- **Class Size (avg/max)**: [avg: X lines, max: Y lines]
- **Duplication**: [X% or "Y instances"]

### Test Coverage
- **Overall Coverage**: [X%]
- **Lines Covered**: [X/Y]
- **Branches Covered**: [X/Y]
- **Functions Covered**: [X/Y]

### Performance
- **Build Time**: [X seconds]
- **Bundle Size**: [X KB]
- **Runtime Performance**: [X ms for key operations]
- **Memory Usage**: [X MB]

### Dependencies
- **Direct Dependencies**: [count]
- **Total Dependencies**: [count including transitive]
- **Outdated Dependencies**: [count]

## Target Metrics
*Goals to achieve - measurable success criteria*

### Code Quality Goals
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Reduce to [target number] (from [baseline])
- **Lines of Code**: Reduce to [target] or acceptable if increased due to clarity
- **Duplication**: Eliminate [X instances] or reduce to [Y%]
- **Function Length**: Max [N lines], avg [M lines]
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain or increase to [X%]

### Performance Goals
- **Build Time**: Maintain or improve (no regression)
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce by [X KB] or maintain
- **Runtime Performance**: Maintain or improve (no regression > 5%)
- **Memory Usage**: Maintain or reduce

### Success Threshold
**Minimum acceptable improvement**: [Define what "success" means]
Example: "Reduce duplication by 50%, maintain test coverage, no performance regression"

## Behavior Preservation Guarantee
*CRITICAL: Refactoring MUST NOT change external behavior*

### External Contracts Unchanged
- [ ] API endpoints return same responses
- [ ] Function signatures unchanged (or properly deprecated)
- [ ] Component props unchanged
- [ ] CLI arguments unchanged
- [ ] Database schema unchanged
- [ ] File formats unchanged

### Test Suite Validation
- [ ] **All existing tests MUST pass WITHOUT modification**
- [ ] If test needs changing, verify it was testing implementation detail, not behavior
- [ ] Do NOT weaken assertions to make tests pass

### Behavioral Snapshot
**Key behaviors to preserve**:
1. [Behavior 1: specific observable output for given input]
2. [Behavior 2: specific side effect or state change]
3. [Behavior 3: specific error handling]

**Test**: Run before and after refactoring, outputs MUST be identical

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level Justification
**Why [High/Medium/Low] Risk**:
[Explain based on: code touched, user impact, complexity, blast radius]

### Potential Issues
- **Risk 1**: [What could go wrong]
  - **Mitigation**: [How to prevent/detect]
  - **Rollback**: [How to undo if occurs]

- **Risk 2**: [Another potential issue]
  - **Mitigation**: [Prevention strategy]
  - **Rollback**: [Recovery plan]

### Safety Measures
- [ ] Feature flag available for gradual rollout
- [ ] Monitoring in place for key metrics
- [ ] Rollback plan tested
- [ ] Incremental commits (can revert partially)
- [ ] Peer review required
- [ ] Staging environment test required

## Rollback Plan

### How to Undo
1. [Step 1: revert commit range]
2. [Step 2: any manual cleanup needed]
3. [Step 3: verification steps]

### Rollback Triggers
Revert if any of these occur within 24-48 hours:
- [ ] Test suite failure
- [ ] Performance regression > 10%
- [ ] Production error rate increase
- [ ] User-facing bug reports related to refactored area
- [ ] Monitoring alerts

### Recovery Time Objective
**RTO**: [How fast can we rollback? e.g., "< 30 minutes"]

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline (Before Refactoring)
1. Capture all baseline metrics (run `.specify/extensions/workflows/refactor/measure-metrics.sh`)
2. Create behavioral snapshot (document current outputs)
3. Ensure 100% test pass rate
4. Tag current state in git: `git tag pre-refactor-### -m "Baseline before refactor-###"`

### Phase 2: Refactoring (Incremental)
1. [Step 1: small, atomic change]
2. [Step 2: another small change]
3. [Step 3: continue incrementally]

**Principle**: Each step should compile and pass tests

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Run full test suite (MUST pass 100%)
2. Re-measure all metrics
3. Compare behavioral snapshot (MUST be identical)
4. Performance regression test
5. Manual testing of critical paths

### Phase 4: Deployment
1. Code review focused on behavior preservation
2. Deploy to staging
3. Monitor for 24 hours
4. Deploy to production with feature flag (if available)
5. Monitor for 48-72 hours
6. Remove feature flag if stable
