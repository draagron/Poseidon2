# Feature Specification: UDP Logging Documentation Cleanup

**Feature Branch**: `004-removal-of-udp`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Removal of UDP logging leftovers as per description in user_requirements/'R003 - cleanup udp leftovers'.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Remove obsolete UDP logging references
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, system operators
   ‚Üí Actions: Update documentation
   ‚Üí Data: Documentation files (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
   ‚Üí Constraints: System now uses WebSocket logging exclusively
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí None - scope is clear: documentation-only changes
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: Developer reads documentation and finds accurate WebSocket logging instructions
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable via documentation review
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí N/A - documentation-only feature
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí No implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with the Poseidon2 codebase, I need accurate documentation that reflects the current WebSocket-based logging system, so I can correctly configure logging, troubleshoot issues, and understand the system's debugging capabilities without being misled by obsolete UDP logging references.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer reads the README.md file, **When** they look for logging configuration instructions, **Then** they find only WebSocket logging documentation with correct port and usage examples
2. **Given** a developer reads the CLAUDE.md file, **When** they review the Network Debugging section, **Then** they find WebSocket logging described as the primary debugging mechanism without UDP references
3. **Given** a developer troubleshoots connection issues, **When** they follow the troubleshooting guide, **Then** they are instructed to monitor WebSocket logs (not UDP logs)
4. **Given** a developer reviews the project structure documentation, **When** they read about utility components, **Then** they see WebSocketLogger referenced (not UDPLogger)
5. **Given** a developer examines configuration examples, **When** they review logging setup, **Then** all examples use WebSocket logging patterns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when legacy UDP references remain in spec files (specs/001-create-feature-spec/*)? These are historical documents and should be noted as "legacy implementation" if they describe UDP logging.
- How does the system handle references to UDP in the constitution (.specify/memory/constitution.md)? These should be updated if they prescribe UDP as a requirement, but preserved if they are historical context.
- What about UDP references in example code (examples/poseidongw/)? These are reference implementations and may represent different architectural decisions - should be evaluated case-by-case.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System documentation MUST describe WebSocket logging as the primary debugging mechanism
- **FR-002**: README.md MUST contain accurate WebSocket logging setup instructions with correct port number
- **FR-003**: CLAUDE.md MUST reference WebSocketLogger utility instead of UDPLogger in project structure documentation
- **FR-004**: Troubleshooting guides MUST instruct users to monitor WebSocket logs for debugging
- **FR-005**: All configuration examples MUST demonstrate WebSocket logging patterns (not UDP broadcast)
- **FR-006**: Historical spec files (specs/001-*/) MUST be clearly marked as "legacy" if they contain UDP logging references that differ from current implementation
- **FR-007**: Constitutional requirements (.specify/memory/constitution.md) MUST reflect WebSocket logging if they prescribe logging implementation
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain consistency across all documentation files regarding logging mechanism
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST include WebSocket connection instructions (e.g., ws://device-ip/logs endpoint)
- **FR-010**: Performance characteristics documented MUST reflect WebSocket logging behavior (not UDP broadcast)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Documentation updates MUST be completed without changing any production code
- **NFR-002**: Updated documentation MUST be immediately usable by new developers without confusion
- **NFR-003**: Historical accuracy MUST be preserved in spec files where UDP was the actual implementation at that time

## Scope Summary

### Files Requiring Updates
Based on grep analysis, the following files contain UDP logging references that need review:

**Primary Documentation (MUST update):**
- README.md
- CLAUDE.md

**Historical/Spec Files (evaluate for "legacy" marking):**
- specs/001-create-feature-spec/* (plan.md, quickstart.md, research.md, spec.md, tasks.md)

**Configuration Files (review):**
- src/config.h (UDP_DEBUG_PORT constant)

**Example/Reference Code (evaluate case-by-case):**
- examples/poseidongw/* (may represent different architectural decisions)

**Test Files (evaluate):**
- test/test_wifi_*/*.cpp (may contain UDP references in comments or legacy test code)

### Out of Scope
- Code changes to src/ directory (WebSocket logging already implemented)
- Test functionality changes (tests may reference UDP for historical validation)
- Changes to examples/poseidongw/ (external reference implementation)
