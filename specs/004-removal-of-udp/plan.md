## Summary
Remove obsolete UDP logging references from documentation and update to reflect the current WebSocket-based logging implementation. The system was migrated from UDP broadcast logging (unreliable, packet loss) to WebSocket logging (TCP-based, reliable, guaranteed delivery) but documentation still contains outdated UDP references. This creates confusion for developers trying to configure logging and troubleshoot issues.

**Technical Approach**: Systematic documentation review and update across README.md, CLAUDE.md, constitution.md, and config.h. Historical spec files will be marked as "legacy implementation" to preserve accuracy. No production code changes required.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Markdown (documentation), C++ (config comments only)
**Primary Dependencies**: None (documentation-only)
**Storage**: N/A (documentation files)
**Testing**: Manual review and validation
**Target Platform**: Documentation (cross-platform)
**Project Type**: Embedded (ESP32 marine gateway)
**Performance Goals**: N/A (documentation-only)
**Constraints**: Must preserve historical accuracy in legacy spec files
**Scale/Scope**: ~15 documentation files requiring review, ~8 requiring updates

**Current Implementation Status**:
- WebSocketLogger implemented in `src/utils/WebSocketLogger.h` and `WebSocketLogger.cpp`
- WebSocket endpoint: `ws://<device-ip>/logs` (default path: `/logs`)
- Python client available: `src/helpers/ws_logger.py`
- Protocol: TCP-based WebSocket (reliable, ordered delivery)
- Features: Auto-reconnect, log filtering, colored output, JSON format
- Integration: Attached to AsyncWebServer in main.cpp:109

**Obsolete UDP References Found**:
- README.md: Lines referencing UDP port 4444, UDP debug logging setup
- CLAUDE.md: Network Debugging sections, troubleshooting guides
- constitution.md: Principle V (Network-Based Debugging) prescribes UDP logging
- src/config.h: UDP_DEBUG_PORT constant (line 18)
- Various spec files: Historical references in specs/001-create-feature-spec/*

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Structure Decision**: Documentation-only updates. No source code changes required except potential comment updates in config.h. Historical spec files (specs/001-*) will be marked as "legacy implementation" to preserve historical accuracy while preventing developer confusion.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers found** - Documentation-only feature with clear scope.

### Research Tasks:
1. **Audit current WebSocket logging implementation**:
   - Decision: WebSocket logging fully implemented in src/utils/WebSocketLogger.{h,cpp}
   - Rationale: Provides reliable TCP-based delivery vs. UDP packet loss
   - Endpoint: ws://<device-ip>/logs
   - Features: Auto-reconnect, filtering, colored output, JSON support

2. **Catalog all UDP references in documentation**:
   - Decision: Found 34 files with "UDP" references via grep
   - Primary targets: README.md, CLAUDE.md, constitution.md
   - Secondary targets: specs/001-*, test files (comments only)
   - Out of scope: examples/poseidongw/* (external reference implementation)

3. **Determine WebSocket logging capabilities**:
   - Decision: WebSocket logging provides all UDP logging capabilities plus:
     * Reliable delivery (TCP vs UDP)
     * Ordered message delivery
     * Connection state management
     * Auto-reconnect support
     * Backpressure handling
   - Rationale: Superior to UDP in every measurable way for debugging
   - Client: Python ws_logger.py script (src/helpers/ws_logger.py)

4. **Evaluate constitutional amendment requirements**:
   - Decision: Principle V must be updated from UDP to WebSocket
   - Rationale: Constitution prescribes implementation details; current prescription is obsolete
   - Alternative considered: Remove specific logging mechanism from constitution
   - Rejected because: Specific mechanism (WebSocket) provides architectural guidance

**Output**: research.md documenting current implementation and update strategy

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### 1. Data Model
**N/A** - Documentation-only feature, no data entities involved.

### 2. API Contracts
**N/A** - Documentation-only feature, no API changes.

### 3. Contract Tests
**N/A** - Documentation-only feature.

### 4. Test Scenarios
Extract from user stories (spec.md lines 46-50):

**Scenario 1: Developer reads README for logging setup**
- Given: Developer opens README.md
- When: They search for "logging" or "debug"
- Then: They find WebSocket logging instructions with ws://<ip>/logs endpoint
- Verification: README.md contains "WebSocket" and "ws://<ip>/logs", no "UDP port 4444"

**Scenario 2: Developer troubleshoots connection issues**
- Given: Developer encounters WiFi connection problem
- When: They follow troubleshooting guide in README.md or CLAUDE.md
- Then: They are instructed to run "python3 ws_logger.py <ip>" to monitor logs
- Verification: Troubleshooting sections reference ws_logger.py, not "nc -ul 4444"

**Scenario 3: Developer reviews project architecture**
- Given: Developer reads CLAUDE.md Project Structure
- When: They examine utils/ directory description
- Then: They see WebSocketLogger documented, not UDPLogger
- Verification: CLAUDE.md Project Structure lists WebSocketLogger

**Scenario 4: Developer implements logging in new feature**
- Given: Developer reads constitution for logging requirements
- When: They review Principle V (Network-Based Debugging)
- Then: They see WebSocket logging prescribed as the standard
- Verification: constitution.md Principle V describes WebSocket logging

**Scenario 5: Developer reads historical spec files**
- Given: Developer examines specs/001-create-feature-spec/plan.md
- When: They see UDP logging references
- Then: They find clear "LEGACY IMPLEMENTATION" marker at top of file
- Verification: Legacy specs have disclaimer explaining architectural evolution

### 5. Update CLAUDE.md incrementally
This feature will update CLAUDE.md directly as part of implementation (not via script).

**Sections requiring updates**:
- Line 38: "UDP Logging" → "WebSocket Logging"
- Line 76: "UDP broadcast logging" → "WebSocket logging"
- Line 268: "logged via UDP" → "logged via WebSocket"
- Line 291: "Network Debugging (UDP logging implemented?)" → "Network Debugging (WebSocket logging implemented?)"
- Line 304: "UDP logging via remotelog()" → "WebSocket logging via WebSocketLogger"
- Line 322: "UDP debug logging enabled" → "WebSocket debug logging enabled"
- Troubleshooting section: Update all "UDP logs" references to "WebSocket logs"
- Add WebSocket endpoint documentation: ws://<device-ip>/logs

**Output**: Updated CLAUDE.md with WebSocket logging documentation

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate documentation update tasks from Phase 1 scenarios
- Each file requiring update → review task + update task
- Verification task per scenario (5 scenarios = 5 verification tasks)
- Constitution amendment task (separate due to governance impact)

**Task Ordering**:
1. **Research and audit** (Phase 0 complete - informational only)
2. **Constitution amendment** (highest priority - prescriptive document)
3. **Primary documentation updates** (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
4. **Configuration file review** (src/config.h - comment update)
5. **Legacy marking** (specs/001-* disclaimer headers)
6. **Verification tasks** (manual review per scenario)
7. **Final validation** (comprehensive documentation consistency check)

**Parallelization**:
- Constitution, README, CLAUDE can be updated independently [P]
- Legacy marking tasks can be done in parallel [P]
- Verification tasks must be sequential (dependencies on updates)

**Estimated Output**: 12-15 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Task Categories**:
- Amendment tasks (1): Constitution Principle V update
- Update tasks (3): README.md, CLAUDE.md, config.h
- Legacy marking tasks (5): specs/001-* files
- Verification tasks (5): Per scenario validation
- Integration task (1): Final consistency check

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute documentation updates following tasks.md)
**Phase 5**: Validation (verify all scenarios, check consistency across documentation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Constitution Principle V prescribes UDP logging | Current implementation uses WebSocket logging; constitution must reflect reality | Keeping obsolete prescription would mislead developers and violate "documentation reflects implementation" principle |
| Constitution amendment required | Principle V is prescriptive (not descriptive); specifies logging mechanism | Making it descriptive ("network-based logging") loses valuable architectural guidance about using WebSocket for reliability |

**Resolution**: Amend constitution.md Principle V to prescribe WebSocket logging instead of UDP logging. This aligns the constitution with current implementation while preserving architectural guidance value.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
