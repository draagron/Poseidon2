# Feature Specification: WiFi Network Connection with Fallback

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-feature-spec`  
**Created**: Monday, October 6, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create feature spec based on the foundation requirement defined in user_requirements/R001_foundation.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a boat owner with the Poseidon Gateway installed on my vessel, I want the device to automatically connect to available WiFi networks from a predefined list when powered on, so that it can maintain network connectivity for marine data transmission without requiring manual intervention each time the device is restarted.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Poseidon Gateway has a list of predefined WiFi networks with SSIDs and passwords, **When** the device powers on, **Then** it attempts to connect to the first network in the list
2. **Given** the Poseidon Gateway is attempting to connect to the first WiFi network in the list, **When** the connection fails, **Then** it proceeds to attempt connection to the next network in the list
3. **Given** the Poseidon Gateway has tried all WiFi networks in the predefined list, **When** none of the connections succeed, **Then** the device reboots and repeats the connection process
4. **Given** the Poseidon Gateway successfully connects to a WiFi network from the list, **When** the connection is established, **Then** the device remains connected and continues with its normal operations
5. **Given** the Poseidon Gateway has connected to a WiFi network, **When** the connection is lost, **Then** the device attempts to reconnect to the same network before trying others

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the network credential file is corrupted or missing?
- How does the system handle networks that require additional authentication (e.g., enterprise WiFi)?
- What happens if there's a temporary network outage during the connection process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST store a list of WiFi network credentials (SSID and password) in a file that can be uploaded to ESP32 EEPROM
- **FR-002**: System MUST attempt to connect to WiFi networks in the order they appear in the predefined list
- **FR-003**: System MUST proceed to the next network in the list when the current network connection attempt fails
- **FR-004**: System MUST reboot and restart the connection process if all predefined WiFi networks fail to connect
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain the established WiFi connection for continuous operation of the Poseidon Gateway
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a mechanism to update the list of WiFi network credentials [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: method for updating credentials file not specified]
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate a README file with setup instructions for network configuration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific setup steps not detailed]
- **FR-008**: System MUST document the project structure in the README file [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact structure to be documented not specified]

### Key Entities
- **WiFi Network List**: A collection of network credentials (SSID and password) stored in EEPROM that the system uses for connection attempts
- **Network Connection Status**: The current state of the WiFi connection (connected, connecting, failed, etc.)
- **Credentials File**: An editable file format that can be uploaded to EEPROM containing WiFi network information
