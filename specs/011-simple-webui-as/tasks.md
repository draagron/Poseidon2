# Tasks: Simple WebUI for BoatData Streaming

**Feature Branch**: `011-simple-webui-as`
**Input**: Design documents from `/home/niels/Dev/Poseidon2/specs/011-simple-webui-as/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/ (all completed)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify existing infrastructure and create new components structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (US1): Can start after Phase 2
  - User Story 2 (US2): Can start after Phase 2 (independent of US1)
  - User Story 3 (US3): Depends on US1 + US2 completion (needs both WebSocket streaming and HTML hosting)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1, can run in parallel
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 + US2 completion - Needs both WebSocket endpoint and HTML hosting working

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (T022-T028 before T029-T038)
- JSON serialization (Phase 2) before WebSocket endpoint (Phase 3)
- WebSocket endpoint before HTML dashboard client code (Phase 5)
- HTML structure before CSS styles and JavaScript (can parallelize within Phase 5)
- All implementation before browser testing
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks can run in parallel (T001-T006 are independent checks)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Contract test T007 can run in parallel with implementation start T008
- **US1 Tests (T022-T028)**: All test file creation tasks can run in parallel [P]
- **US2 Tests (T039-T040)**: Both test tasks can run in parallel [P]
- **US3 HTML Structure (T053-T054)**: Document structure and status indicator can run in parallel [P]
- **US3 CSS Styles (T065-T071)**: All CSS tasks can run in parallel [P] (same file but independent sections)
- **US3 Unit Conversions (T078-T082)**: All conversion functions can run in parallel [P]
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: Documentation tasks T123-T124 can run in parallel [P], test suites T109-T112 can run in parallel [P]

**Note**: Tasks modifying the same file (e.g., data/stream.html) must run sequentially unless they edit independent sections

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 Foundational

```bash
# These two can start together:
Task: "Write contract test for BoatDataSerializer::toJSON() in test/test_webui_contracts/test_serializer_contract.cpp"
Task: "Implement BoatDataSerializer::toJSON() core structure with StaticJsonDocument<2048>"

# All US1 test creation tasks can run together:
Task: "Write contract test for WebSocket endpoint connection"
Task: "Write integration test for WebSocket connection flow"
Task: "Write integration test for JSON data flow"
Task: "Write integration test for multi-client support"
Task: "Write unit test for JSON format validation"
Task: "Write unit test for serialization performance"
Task: "Write unit test for broadcast throttling"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T021) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T022-T038)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test WebSocket endpoint with test client
5. Deploy/demo if ready (WebSocket streaming functional)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation**: Complete Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2) ‚Üí JSON serialization ready
2. **MVP**: Add User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo (WebSocket streaming works!)**
3. **Enhancement**: Add User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo (HTML page serves!)**
4. **Complete**: Add User Story 3 (Phase 5) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo (Full dashboard!)**
5. **Production**: Polish (Phase 6) ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí **Deploy to boat!**

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - WebSocket endpoint
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Phase 4) - HTTP file server (parallel with A)
   - Developer C: Start User Story 3 HTML structure (T053-T064) while waiting for A+B
3. **After US1 + US2 complete**:
   - Developer C: Complete User Story 3 (Phase 5) - Full dashboard
   - Developer A/B: Start Polish tasks (Phase 6) in parallel

## Memory Footprint Summary

**RAM Usage** (cumulative):
- BoatDataSerializer: ~2KB transient (StaticJsonDocument<2048>)
- WebSocket endpoint: ~100 bytes persistent
- HTTP file server: ~50 bytes persistent
- 5 concurrent clients: ~20KB (ESPAsyncWebServer buffers)
- **Total peak**: ~22KB (~6.9% of ESP32 RAM)

**Flash Usage** (cumulative):
- BoatDataSerializer: ~3KB code
- WebSocket endpoint: ~2KB code
- HTTP file server: ~1KB code
- HTML dashboard: ~18KB (LittleFS storage)
- Test code: ~12KB (not included in production build)
- **Total production**: ~24KB (~1.3% of 1.9MB partition)

**Constitutional Compliance**: ‚úì Well under resource limits (Principle II)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3) for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- File paths are absolute: `/home/niels/Dev/Poseidon2/...`
- HTML tasks (T053-T093) all modify `data/stream.html` - coordinate carefully or work sequentially
- Browser testing (T096-T108) requires ESP32 hardware and WiFi connection
- QA review (T130) is mandatory per Constitutional Principle III
