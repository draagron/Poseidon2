## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a boat operator, I need a centralized system that collects data from multiple marine sensors (GPS, compass, wind vane, speed sensors), prioritizes data from the most reliable sources, calculates derived sailing parameters (true wind speed, leeway, VMG), and allows me to calibrate the system through a simple web interface so that I can make informed sailing decisions based on accurate real-time data.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Single Source GPS Data
1. **Given** the system has one GPS sensor connected via NMEA0183
   **When** the GPS sensor sends position data (latitude/longitude)
   **Then** the system stores and makes available the current position data

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Source GPS with Automatic Prioritization
1. **Given** the system has:
   - GPS-A (NMEA0183) updating at 1 Hz (once per second)
   - GPS-B (NMEA2000) updating at 10 Hz (ten times per second)
   **When** both sensors are providing valid data
   **Then** the system uses GPS-B data (higher update frequency = higher priority)

#### Scenario 3: Source Failover
1. **Given** the system is using GPS-B (10 Hz) as the primary source
   **When** GPS-B stops sending data
   **Then** the system automatically switches to GPS-A (1 Hz) as the fallback source

#### Scenario 4: User Priority Override
1. **Given** the system has auto-prioritized GPS-B over GPS-A
   **When** the user manually sets GPS-A as the preferred source via configuration
   **Then** the system uses GPS-A regardless of update frequency

#### Scenario 5: Derived Parameter Calculation
1. **Given** the system has valid data from:
   - GPS (latitude, longitude, COG, SOG)
   - Compass (heading, variation)
   - Wind vane (apparent wind angle, apparent wind speed)
   - Speed sensor (boat speed, heel angle)
   **When** the calculation cycle triggers (every 200ms)
   **Then** the system calculates and updates all derived parameters:
   - True wind speed (TWS)
   - True wind angle (TWA)
   - Speed through water (STW)
   - Velocity made good (VMG)
   - Wind direction (WDIR)
   - Current speed and direction (SOC, DOC)
   - Leeway angle

#### Scenario 6: Calibration Parameter Update
1. **Given** the user accesses the web calibration interface
   **When** the user updates the "Leeway Calibration Factor" from 0.5 to 0.65
   **Then** the system persists the new calibration value and uses it in subsequent calculations

#### Scenario 7: Outlier Detection
1. **Given** the GPS sensor has been reporting valid position data (latitude 40.7128¬∞N)
   **When** the GPS sensor sends an invalid reading (latitude 200¬∞N - outside valid range)
   **Then** the system rejects the outlier and continues using the last valid position

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when all sources for a sensor type fail?** System should mark that data type as unavailable and continue operating with degraded functionality.
- **What happens when sensor data is partially valid?** System should accept valid fields and ignore invalid fields within the same message.
- **How does the system handle initial startup with no data?** All data fields should have a clear "not available" state until first valid reading received.
- **What happens during calibration updates while calculations are running?** Calibration changes should be applied atomically to prevent calculation errors.
- **How does the system detect a "stale" data source?** Data is considered stale if no update received within 5 seconds, triggering automatic failover to next-priority source.
- **What happens when compass heading wraps around (359¬∞ ‚Üí 0¬∞)?** Calculations must handle angle wraparound correctly.
- **How are negative angles represented (port vs starboard)?** Consistently use radians with negative/positive for port/starboard.
