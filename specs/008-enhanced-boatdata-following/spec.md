## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: What representation should be used for battery state of charge (stateOfChargeA/B)? ‚Üí A: Percentage 0-100 (integer or float, e.g., 75.5% = 75.5)
- Q: What unit should be used for engine oil temperature (oilTemperature field)? ‚Üí A: Celsius (consistent with existing seaTemperature in DSTData)
- Q: How should the system handle missing or unavailable sensor data (e.g., GPS variation not provided, depth sensor offline)? ‚Üí A: Set field to zero with availability flag false
- Q: What sign convention should be used for battery amperage (positive/negative for charging/discharging)? ‚Üí A: Positive = charging, negative = discharging
- Q: The user requirements specify converting measuredBoatSpeed from its current unit to m/s. What is the current unit? ‚Üí A: Already in m/s - no conversion needed

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a boat operator, I need access to comprehensive boat sensor data through a centralized data model so that monitoring systems can display accurate vessel status including navigation (GPS, compass), motion (heel, pitch, heave, rate of turn), environment (depth, water temperature), propulsion (engine, saildrive), and electrical systems (batteries, shore power).

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** GPS system is receiving position data, **When** magnetic variation is available, **Then** variation value is stored in GPSData (not CompassData)

2. **Given** compass sensor is active, **When** vessel is turning, **Then** rate of turn is captured in radians/second

3. **Given** vessel is underway, **When** motion sensors detect heel and pitch, **Then** angles are recorded in CompassData with correct sign conventions (starboard/bow up positive)

4. **Given** depth sounder is operating, **When** water depth is measured, **Then** depth below waterline is stored in meters in DSTData

5. **Given** DST sensor is active, **When** water temperature is measured, **Then** temperature in Celsius is stored in DSTData

6. **Given** engine is running, **When** engine sensors report data, **Then** RPM, oil temperature, and alternator voltage are captured in EngineData

7. **Given** saildrive system has position sensor, **When** saildrive engagement changes, **Then** engagement state (true/false) is recorded in SaildriveData

8. **Given** dual battery system is installed, **When** battery monitors report, **Then** voltage, amperage, state of charge, and charger status are captured for both Battery A and Battery B

9. **Given** shore power is connected, **When** power consumption is measured, **Then** connection status and wattage are stored in ShorePowerData

### Edge Cases
- What happens when sensors provide data outside expected ranges? System MUST clamp values to valid ranges and log warnings
- How does system handle missing sensor data (e.g., GPS variation unavailable)? Field set to zero with availability flag false
- What happens when heel angle exceeds ¬±90¬∞? Value clamped to [-œÄ/2, œÄ/2] range with warning logged
- How are negative depth readings handled (sensor above water)? Negative values set to zero with availability flag false
- What happens when battery state of charge readings are inconsistent? Accept sensor value if within 0-100 range, otherwise set to zero with availability flag false

### Testing Strategy (ESP32 embedded system)
**Mock-First Approach** (Constitutional requirement):
- **Contract Tests**: Validate data structure field types, ranges, and units with mock sensor data
- **Integration Tests**: Test data aggregation across multiple sensor sources with mocked NMEA2000, NMEA0183, and 1-wire interfaces
- **Unit Tests**: Validate unit conversions (if needed), sign conventions, data migrations from old to new structure
- **Hardware Tests**: Validate actual sensor data parsing from NMEA2000, NMEA0183, and 1-wire devices on ESP32

**Test Organization** (PlatformIO grouped tests):
- `test_boatdata_contracts/` - Data structure validation, field presence, type checking
- `test_boatdata_integration/` - Multi-sensor data aggregation scenarios
- `test_boatdata_units/` - Unit conversion validation, sign convention checks
- `test_boatdata_hardware/` - Real sensor data parsing (NMEA/1-wire protocols)
