**‚ö†Ô∏è LEGACY IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE**

This specification describes the initial WiFi management implementation which used UDP broadcast logging (port 4444). The system has since been migrated to WebSocket logging for improved reliability.

**Current Implementation**: WebSocket logging via `ws://<device-ip>/logs`
**Historical Implementation** (described below): UDP broadcast logging on port 4444

This document is preserved for historical reference and architectural decision context. For current logging setup, see [README.md](../../README.md) and [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

# Feature Specification: WiFi Network Management Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-feature-spec`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create feature spec based on the foundation requirement defined in user_requirements/R001_foundation.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What is the connection timeout per WiFi network attempt? ‚Üí A: 30 seconds - Balanced approach for typical conditions
- Q: When a connected WiFi network drops (connection lost after successful connection), what should the gateway do? ‚Üí A: Retry current network only (stay loyal to last successful)
- Q: What is the maximum number of WiFi networks supported in the configuration? ‚Üí A: 3 networks - Minimal (home/marina/alternate)
- Q: Should other gateway services wait for WiFi connection, or run in parallel during WiFi connection attempts? ‚Üí A: All services run independently (no WiFi dependency)
- Q: What format should the WiFi configuration file use? ‚Üí A: Plain text - Simple line-based format (SSID,password per line)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Poseidon Gateway device, I need to automatically connect to a known WiFi network at startup so that I can communicate with boat instruments and SignalK servers. The gateway should attempt to connect to networks from a predefined list in priority order, and retry indefinitely until successful connection is established.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the gateway has a list of 3 configured WiFi networks, **When** the device boots and the first network is available, **Then** the gateway connects to the first network and proceeds with normal operation.

2. **Given** the gateway has a list of 3 configured WiFi networks, **When** the device boots and the first network is unavailable but the second is available, **Then** the gateway skips the first network and connects to the second network.

3. **Given** the gateway has a list of configured WiFi networks, **When** the device boots and none of the networks are available, **Then** the gateway reboots and retries the connection sequence.

4. **Given** a WiFi network configuration file exists, **When** a user uploads the file to the device, **Then** the configuration is stored persistently and survives device reboots.

5. **Given** the gateway is connected to a WiFi network, **When** the connection is lost, **Then** the gateway retries connecting to the current network with 30-second timeout attempts until successful.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the WiFi credentials file is missing on first boot?
- What happens when the WiFi credentials file is corrupted or has invalid format (not comma-separated, more than 3 lines)?
- What happens when a line in the configuration file contains invalid characters or exceeds maximum length?
- How does the system handle networks that require additional authentication (captive portals, enterprise WiFi)?
- Should there be a delay between reboot cycles to avoid rapid reboot loops?
- What feedback (visual/network) indicates connection status during the connection process?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST read WiFi network credentials from a persistent storage location that survives reboots
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple WiFi network configurations (SSID and password pairs)
- **FR-003**: System MUST attempt to connect to WiFi networks in the order they appear in the configuration
- **FR-004**: System MUST skip to the next network if a connection attempt fails within 30 seconds
- **FR-005**: System MUST reboot and retry the entire connection sequence if all configured networks fail to connect
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a mechanism for users to upload/edit the WiFi configuration file
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate WiFi configuration file format (plain text, comma-separated SSID,password per line, maximum 3 lines) before storing it persistently
- **FR-008**: System MUST indicate WiFi connection status (connected/connecting/failed) to other gateway services
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist WiFi configuration data in a non-volatile storage that survives power cycles
- **FR-010**: System MUST support a maximum of 3 WiFi networks in the configuration
- **FR-011**: WiFi connection attempts MUST NOT block other gateway services from starting and operating independently
- **FR-012**: System MUST retry connection to the current network (using same 30-second timeout) when an established connection is lost, without switching to other configured networks

### Key Entities

- **WiFi Network Configuration**: Collection of up to 3 network credentials (SSID, password) with priority ordering. Stored persistently and editable by users. Contains validation rules for SSID format and password length.

- **Connection State**: Tracks current connection attempt, including which network is being tried, connection status, retry count, and time since last attempt. Used to determine when to move to next network or reboot.

- **Configuration File**: User-editable plain text file containing WiFi network credentials. Format: one network per line with SSID and password separated by comma (e.g., "HomeNetwork,password123"). Maximum 3 lines supported.

## Notes for Planning Phase

**Clarifications Deferred to Planning Phase** (low impact or implementation-level):
1. Reboot delay to prevent rapid cycling (default: 5 seconds recommended)
2. Connection status feedback mechanism (LED, OLED display, UDP broadcast?)
3. Handling of missing/corrupted configuration on first boot (factory defaults?)

**Reference Implementation**: `examples/poseidongw/src/main.cpp` lines 1-8 show hardcoded WiFi credentials - this feature will replace that approach with configurable, persistent storage.

**Documentation Requirements** (from user requirements):
- README with setup instructions
- Project structure documentation
